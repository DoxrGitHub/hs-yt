When I first used the `youtubei` module, it was broken, presumably due to newer API responses that the parser was not made for. Except I decided to do a bit of sniffing because this felt like a really good package; the issue wasn't with information not being returned to the client (!!), but rather, it being structured in a way the module didn't expect. So... I spent nearly an hour just going through the cjs build in `node_modules/youtubei/dist/`, reading JSON, figuring out how stuff was supposed to go, replacing the specific broken code, re-running the program to find the new error, rinse and repeat. I ended up finding even MORE errors across multiple days, but `youtubei` handles InnerTube (internal YouTube API) beautifully and I didn't want to go diving to replace youtubei.

In the (hopefully near) future the issue will probably be officially fixed. As of right now, though, I had to do all that and I really don't want to lose the monkey-patched script until it is not necessary. Therefore, I backed it up.
