# HS-YT
Anonymous/Privacy Focused YouTube Client | Submission for High Seas

Before starting, I thank the people hosting the default Invidious instances! It is probably not easy to host a service like that and Invidious is currently a dependency because of it's trending feeds and search API. HS-YT was inspired by Invidious, but uses official YouTube embeds (youtube-nocookie) and such to ensure heavy video streaming isn't a problem for either the person hosting or the user.

It is a goal to use YouTube endpoints directly instead of using an Invidious instance's APIs. So thanks again.
